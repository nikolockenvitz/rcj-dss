# Guide for Referees/Users

The page consists of 8 different screens which you will walk-through sequentially in general.

<table>
<tr><td>Screenshot</td><td>Description</td></tr>
<tr><td>S1</td><td>
In the upper half you can enter your credentials.
They are needed for submitting runs to a server.
Hint 1: The credentials can also be supplied in the URL (e.g. by scanning a QR-Code) so you don't need to enter them neccessarily.
Hint 2: You don't need credentials if you don't want to submit the runs, but you need to enter something before you can continue.

Below you can enter some details about the competition / the arena you are at.

You will do this setup once or at least not so often.

At the bottom you see a big navigation button to go to the next screen (S2) and the button "View Data" which leads to S8 (more details later).
</td></tr>
<tr><td>S2</td><td>
This is the screen where you normally will start for each run.
You can see the information entered in setup above so that you can check this everytime before a run starts and go back if you notice that you need to change something.

Below you can select the team from a list.
The list depends on which competition you selected in S1 (Line / Line Entry).
The selected competition influences also whether you are able to select the evacuation point (low/high) or whether this is set automatically (for Line Entry).

After selecting the team and asking them for the evacuation point you can continue to the next screen (S3).

<tr><td>S3</td><td>

Everything gets stored in Cache/LocalStorage so that no data will be lost unless you clear the storage.
Even your current page is saved (so you will see the same screen after reloading).
Please don't use system navigation buttons (like "Back") but instead navigation buttons offered to you on the screens.
